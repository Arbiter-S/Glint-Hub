# GlintHub  

GlintHub is a feature-rich backend API built for an e-commerce platform specializing in gold products.
Developed with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF), it integrates essential functionalities such as real-time gold
price updates, user account verification through email, and secure payment processing using the Zarinpal gateway. 
With Nginx serving as a reverse proxy, GlintHub is optimized for performance, reliability, and scalabilityâ€”making it
a robust solution for modern e-commerce needs.
